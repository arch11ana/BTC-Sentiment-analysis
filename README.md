# BTC-Sentiment-analysis
# Cryptocurrency Sentiment & Trend Analysis

This project is about understanding how people feel about popular cryptocurrencies
like **Bitcoin (BTC), Solana (SOL), and Ripple (XRP)** by analyzing text data using
Natural Language Processing (NLP).

Instead of just looking at price charts, this project focuses on **public sentiment**
and tries to understand whether people are talking positively, negatively, or neutrally
about these cryptocurrencies.

-> What does this project do?

- Takes cryptocurrency-related text data
- Applies sentiment analysis using NLP techniques
- Classifies the sentiment as positive, negative, or neutral
- Compares sentiment trends across BTC, SOL, and XRP

This helps in understanding **market mood** and public opinion around cryptocurrencies.

-> Why is this useful?

- Public sentiment often influences crypto price movements
- Investors and analysts can use sentiment insights for better decisions
- It shows how NLP can be applied to real-world financial data

-> Tools & Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Jupyter Notebook
