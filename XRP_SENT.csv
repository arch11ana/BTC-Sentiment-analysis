Why are XRP users the best at blowing smoke?,"XRP is 100% riding a giant wave of red on only fact alone: the chairman of the SEC stepped down.

We need to have a serious talk about Marketcaps. ,"On the XRP sub and other places filled with XRP Maxis, people are saying XRP is going to hit $100 as if it's a very real and very feasible target for the community. Let's talk about what exactly that would look like. XRP has a circulating supply of 57B. At a price of $100 each that would put the marketcap of XRP at $5.7T. OVER 3X the current marketcap of BTC, and this doesn't even consider the inevitable increase in circulating supply as time passes.

Look I get it, it's fun to dream about 25x (or 250x gains for people talking about XRP to $1,000 - I'm dead serious people are talking about this) but don't let those dreams cause you to make bad investment decisions.

\---------

**You want to know what other community was talking about having a $5.9T marketcap in 2021?** In 2021 Shiba Inu to $.01 was all the rage as people swore that it was a realistic and feasible target for the meme token and many made terrible investment decisions as a result swearing that Shiba Inu was going to hit $.01. Looking at Shiba Inu now it's.... not even close to it's 2021 ATH, and lets be clear will never hit $.01.

I hope people can see whats happening with US based cryptos and Bitcoin,"Crypto investor since 2017, made good money, enough to quit my job in my mid 30s and travel and start a business and do other things I want with my life. Doesnt mean I know anything.

It is my belief that at some point, just like every other market, there will be a bust/selection period where 99% of projects become worthless. Of the remaining survivors, maybe 5-6 take up 80-85% of the market share, 5-6 take up 5-10% and the remaining hundreds or thousands of coins make up the last 5-10%

Example: Theres Verizon, Att, T mobile at the top, then theres tracfone and boost and mint mobile, then theres 100 that nobody knows anything about. There are 100s of brands of batteries but very few companies who actually make the batteries. Tons of tv companies, 5-6 that people know, dozens that we dont, 100s of other ones, and only a handful of huge manufacturers that make everyones tvs at the same place.

This is what will happen IMO because it always does, since forever.

And while I dont really care if youre a fan of the US or not, the US is the strongest economy in the world, and it is in the best position to harness this and benefit from it and control the direction of the space in the US and global narrative. Im not saying this is the best for crypto or the world, but I think it's ignorant to outright say it wont matter.

With the US and other countries getting on board with a strategic reserve, its clear bitcoin is and will continue to be a winner for the foreseeable future.

I believe this is also why we have the Dino/US coins pumping as their leaders have recently all been meeting together with some of them like Hoskinson even getting involved directly with legislators, meeting with senators, getting in front of congress and talking about what is best for us. Founders have all recently met, are all ISO 20022 compliant, and are all going nuts. I think this is a winning recipe for this cycle and for the future and I just want people to be aware of it. These projects **XLM XRP ADA HBAR ALGO** are outperforming a lot of other coins and I believe this is why, despite people starting to call them all irrelevant before this happened.

I am saying this because this is my third cycle in the space and have wasted time and money looking for pumpy coins when if I had just kept my money where I had it 7 years ago in these Dino coins (in XRP and ADA anyways), id have been proven right in my early conviction of these projects. Look at the narrative, research it, and make an educated guess. Do not ignore these trends and its ok to take risks on meme coins with a little bit of your portfolio but make sure you are on the right side of history when it all shakes out, because it will at some point in the not so distant future.",1732914715.0,hope people see whats happening us based cryptos bitcoin crypto investor since made good money enough quit job mid travel start business things want life doesnt mean know anything belief point like every market bustselection period projects become worthless remaining survivors maybe take market share take remaining hundreds thousands coins make last example theres verizon att mobile top theres tracfone boost mint mobile theres nobody knows anything brands batteries companies actually make batteries tons tv companies people know dozens dont ones handful huge manufacturers make everyones tvs place happen imo always since forever dont really care youre fan us us strongest economy world best position harness benefit control direction space us global narrative im saying best crypto world think ignorant outright say wont matter us countries getting board strategic reserve clear bitcoin continue winner foreseeable future believe also dinous coins pumping leaders recently meeting together like hoskinson even getting involved directly legislators meeting senators getting front congress talking best us founders recently met iso compliant going nuts think winning recipe cycle future want people aware projects xlm xrp ada hbar algo outperforming lot coins believe despite people starting call irrelevant happened saying third cycle space wasted time money looking pumpy coins kept money years ago dino coins xrp ada anyways id proven right early conviction projects look narrative research make educated guess ignore trends ok take risks meme coins little bit portfolio make sure right side history shakes point distant future,0.9867,positive,2024-11-29 21:11:55

Possible Collaboration of XRP & ADA?,"This is all just my speculation, here are some events which happened recently for ADA and XRP:

\-Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson announced plans to work with the incoming Trump administration to develop clear crypto regulations. 

\-Charles Hoskinson talked to the CEO of Ripple (Brad Garlinghouse), and it seems like they buried their beef. Also Charles was saying the CEO was ""extremly collaborative"" 

\-Now he had a talk with the Chief of Technology (CTO) of Ripple. Maybe they plan to collaborate and that's why he talked with the CTO of Ripple afterwards? 

\-Trump plans to remove capital gains tax from US cryptocurrencies (this would include XRP and ADA)

\- There is a rumor Brad Garlinghouse met with Trump 

There are many common grounds and goals and a very promising environment. The market is reacting and the price of those coins are moving despite there is not an official partnership announcement.

"The worst part about being into crypto in 2014 wasn’t that people didn’t believe you, it was how they talked down to you and tried to ‘educate you’.","It was infuriating.  I remember discovering Dogecoin back in early 2014 when $500 would buy you a million, and my friend tried to explain to me (patiently) how that was just a fad and if i really wanted to be a millionaire one day I needed to read some 'Boglehead books' and learn about ETFs and mutual funds.  

When i tried to tell my coworkers about bitcoin they all patiently explained to me (how an adult might explain to a child) that Bitcoin wasn't actually worth anything and it wasn't ""backed by anything"".  

I was excited to meet my girlfriend's friend's boyfriend once because i heard he was into finance.  He basically spent the entire dinner cracking jokes at my expense and explaining how little i understood money.  

When i tried to tell my investment buddy about Monero, and begged him to get into it at 30 cents, he thought it was stupid and said he thought Visa was a better investment for money.  Then when Monero went to $2 each and i continued to rant to him his reaction was ""nice, you sold it all right?"".  Then when it went to $12 each he legit got mad at me that I wouldn't sell it.  By the time it was $50 each he stopped talking to me.  

If you've been in crypto for more than 10 years, it's been an exhausting and frustrating experience.  

And no, I'm not even close to rich.  I've lost all my money since then thanks to bad investments, taxes, and overspending.

XRP -self custody wallets released 9xrp ,"Ripple wallets have always taken a 10xrp reserved amount that becomes locked up and won't show in balance.


Very recently with the dramatic rise in xrp value, ripple reduced the reserved component from 10xrp to 1xrp.

meaning anyone with a xrp wallet can now withdraw 9 xrp (~$22).

most wallet software (trust for example) still won't show it available.

however if you load up the official ripple supported wallet - xaman - you'll see the 9xrp and can withdraw it right away.

i managed to collect $44 from my 2 wallets.

obviously you must have the PK for the wallet, not relevant to exchange wallets.

The scariest thing about all of this...,"If 2021 ptsd has thought me anything, it's that any day could be your last day. I remember 2021 where right after the summer all cryptos were exploding like crazy. Felt like a fucking mastermind and kept making screenshots of my gains. All in on Cardano and XRP. There had been huge dips before, and every time it happened, people kept saying ""It's just a healthy correction after all the growth we've had"". And every time they were right; it DID go back up, and not just to the old price before the dip but even higher.

But then around 15 november (literally still know the date from memory) it dipped again, HARD. I kept buying dip after dip thinking I am a genius, and once this mf goes back up to the price of 1-2 weeks ago I will make thousands of profit. But it kept dipping again and again. Damnit I must've had bought my 16th dip by the time I realised that it's too late. We've entered the bear market again and my position for the next 3 years will be to hold these bags in one hand, and this L in my other hand. At one point my bag was from 30k initial investment to 12k (swear to God). Then at the start of this year finally after 2,5 years of stress and praying to see at least my initial investment back, I finally was in the green again. And once again I got greedy and thought, nahh this time I'm gonna make at least 2 x my initial investment, and then I'm out. But again... it dipped like a mf. Then last week I was finally in the green again... and again it dipped like a mf. I'm just here to let people know that any day could be your last and don't get greedy for more. Take profits, or at least take your initial investment out. Don't be a bag holder and carry stress for the coming 3 years like I did MULTIPLE times. I'll be damned if I don't take profits next time I get a chance.
