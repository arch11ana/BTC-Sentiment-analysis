10 things they don't want people to know or post about about Solana (part deux),"1. **75.72%** of all transactions through Jupiter are failing. 

2. **48.71%** of all transactions through Raydium are failing. 

3. Transactions will fail for a **variety of reasons** not just slippage issues. 

4. Voting consensus transactions & failed transactions massively bloat the blockchain size, **currently \~265 TB & growing fast.** 

5. Again, **TPS includes voting consensus and failed transactions**, failed transactions on most other blockchains are strictly validated before even hitting the blockchain. 

6. **Firedancer** is live on mainnet, but in 'non-voting mode' which means it cannot produce blocks and is **only doing about \~30% of what a validator does.** 

7. **RPC endpoint architecture allows operators to reorder transactions and front-run.** 

8. ***$7.5 billion SOL, is continued to be sold-off by FTX, a major unlock occurs in March 2025, and continued unlocks every month up till 2028.*** (Repeated due to importance). 

9. **5 million daily active users is a myth, 4.5 million of these hold 0 SOL, and much more hold < 1, they are created with an intention to inflate metrics,** notice the large uptick in August, also 1 user(bot) could technically have 4 million wallets. 

10. **The Top 18 validators control +33% of the entire staked Solana supply, meaning they can collaboratively block consensus and censor transactions.**

TL;DR: I added a comedy flair for ""comedy"" purposes because if someone told you that this is one of the major crypto networks you'd indeed think that crypto is a scam...

Solana's YTD Inflation Rate is ~13.5%,"https://preview.redd.it/039hbmfottqd1.jpg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0ced01d9a3ff5032a20cd2e32019bc6761e3b255

It seems as though the burn-mechanism isn't working so great on SOL, it has over 13.5% YTD inflation.

When you take into consideration that most of the transactions on SOL are failed or consensus transactions it doesn't paint a great picture.

If you factor in team and VC unlocks the inflation is more like \~20%.

Pretty crazy when you consider that SOL technically has an infinite supply and they've been known to lie about this stuff from the beginning.

"Cardano and Solana, Paul Atkins and David Sacks","
As we now Trump nominated David Sacks as „the Crypto czar“ and Paul Atkins as next SEC Chairman.


Some of us know Sacks as a big paypal guy. And the most of Solana Investors know him as an early Solana investor. Paul Atkins is from my POW less popular, but as the next SEC Chairman hes for sure not less important for the Cryptoindustries. Moreover he also got some Cardano connections, in 2020 he spoke at the Cardano Summit about the mainstream adoption of crypto.

We have two guys which got connection to two successful Blockchain which cant be more different.

One is build on account based model the other one is build on eutxo.
One is made for the speed the other one is made for reliability. 
One goes the scientific way of developing the other one is more like a try and error scheme. 

Lets see what will happen in the future! For sure Solana and Cardano are already in the minds of both of them. But in any case. Every other crypto project will benefit from both guys. Because this guys are in our team now! They will play with us! The game against us will end soon!",1733568926.0,cardano solana paul atkins david sacks trump nominated david sacks crypto czar paul atkins next sec chairman us know sacks big paypal guy solana investors know early solana investor paul atkins pow less popular next sec chairman hes sure less important cryptoindustries moreover also got cardano connections spoke cardano summit mainstream adoption crypto two guys got connection two successful blockchain cant different one build account based model one build eutxo one made speed one made reliability one goes scientific way developing one like try error scheme lets see happen future sure solana cardano already minds case every crypto project benefit guys guys team play us game us end soon,0.9394,positive,2024-12-07 10:55:26

Ethereum just hit a brand new 3.5 year low against Bitcoin. ,"ETH just hit a brand new 3 and a half year low against BTC after touching .03462 beating it's last 3 and a half year low of .03465 set just 8 days ago on Nov. 06th 2024. (.03462 means 1 eth is worth 3.46% of 1 BTC. )

In fact this means ETH has wiped all out gains against BTC since April 2021 when ETH was \~2k and BTC was around \~$60k. Since then ETH has completed the merge moving it from POW to POS and Proto-Danksharding (which dropped the gas cost on L2s). Still in comparing it's value against BTC, ETH has officially lost all of it's bear market gains.

What you might not know is ETH is not alone lots of alts continue to be down against BTC.

Chainlink to BTC is also sitting at a 5 and a half year low.

Perhaps one of the worst performing alts and sub darling, DOT continues to hover near an ATL against BTC.

This list is not comprehensive but many alts are barely above recent bear market lows.

Just for fun I'll also include the Moon to BTC Chart which isn't great but is somehow better looking than a lot of the alts.

Is Solana the new BNB?,"Four years ago when I got into crypto, Binance Smart Chain (BNB) was the peak of meme coin launches, flooding the market, skyrocketing its volume and price.

Now, Solana appears to be in a similar phase with a growth trajectory mirroring BNB's 2020-2021 period's explosion of meme coin projects. Does that mean BNB actually matured past its meme coins/ scam coin phase?

Just some food for though, wondering if others also noticed this, as I couldn't find it being talked about.

P.S. for newer people, meme coins have no inherent value, just speculation. Before investing Google how to recognize ""rug pull"" & ""Honeypot"" 


**EDIT:** just to make sure: I'm not saying SOL is a scam coin at all, just that meme coins have a higher probability to be, regardless of the chain they're on.
