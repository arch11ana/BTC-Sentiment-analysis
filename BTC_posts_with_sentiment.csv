My Accidental Bitcoin Journey Ended Tonight,"I originally bought my first Bitcoins in 2012, while living in Europe, as a means for buying substances of ill repute.  At any given time, I had several of them in an online wallet (don’t even remember where). I eventually stopped partying so much, but still had 3-4 laying around.  By the time I moved back to the US in 2015, I remembered the wallet and was shocked to see that what was originally maybe $50 worth of coins had turned into something like $1500. I didn’t understand it, but that is when I started reading more about it.  I would talk about it with friends and try to convince them to buy.  I eventually built my stack up to about 7 bitcoins by late 2017. As the price soared, I kept imagining my life as a millionaire.  When the crash happened, I forgot all about its cyclic nature and panicked, selling 4 of them around the $7K mark.  I invested that $30K and left the 3 remaining bitcoins in my wallet.  And they stayed there for 6 more years.  In 2023, I sold another one for about $25K to help pay for my wedding. At that point I vowed to not sell my last 2 until it mooned.  Today, my wife and I did something we never thought possible - we made an offer on an investment property.  It was accepted tonight and I sold my last two remaining bitcoins, for just shy of $200K so that I had the funds for a down payment.

Maybe I played the game horribly.  Maybe I would have $700K worth of bitcoin if I stuck to my original plan of keeping 7 bitcoins.  I don’t know. Feels pretty good to turn a pretty small investment into a 25% down payment on an investment property though.

I’ll continue to occasionally buy bitcoin after this, but I recognize that I may never afford to ever get close to owning 1 BTC ever again, let alone multiple.  But I’m ok with it.  I got a debt-free wedding and an investment property out of it.  I’m happy.

Just a little story to say that it’s ok to use your bitcoin to fund your life along the way.  It’s likely part of the journey.  Be well. 


Edit:  I’m blown away by all the responses!  I honestly expected it to be 80% negative.  So, thank you to those well wishers.  I honestly get and understand the negative sentiment.  I found myself in an unbelievably lucky position and squandered it all away (according to naysayers).  I will continue to believe in and buy bitcoin.  There’s still plenty of time to invest in it as a retirement option.  I wanted passive income and diversification, and I don’t think there’s anything wrong with that.  Cheers. 

Edit 2:  Lots of comments/questions about taxes.  Yes, it’s all capital gains. Yes, we are covered. Long story short, my wife worked for a major tech company that paid her in stock as part of her salary. Instead of cashing her shares every month, she kept them and lived off just her salary.  That stock tanked 3 years ago and has lost 70+% of its value.  She finally sold yesterday so that we can write off her losses against my gains.",1732343713.0,accidental bitcoin journey ended tonight originally bought first bitcoins living europe means buying substances ill repute given time several online wallet dont even remember eventually stopped partying much still laying around time moved back us remembered wallet shocked see originally maybe worth coins turned something like didnt understand started reading would talk friends try convince buy eventually built stack bitcoins late price soared kept imagining life millionaire crash happened forgot cyclic nature panicked selling around k mark invested k left remaining bitcoins wallet stayed years sold another one k help pay wedding point vowed sell last mooned today wife something never thought possible made offer investment property accepted tonight sold last two remaining bitcoins shy k funds payment maybe played game horribly maybe would k worth bitcoin stuck original plan keeping bitcoins dont know feels pretty good turn pretty small investment payment investment property though ill continue occasionally buy bitcoin recognize may never afford ever get close owning btc ever let alone multiple im ok got debtfree wedding investment property im happy little story say ok use bitcoin fund life along way likely part journey well edit im blown away responses honestly expected negative thank well wishers honestly get understand negative sentiment found unbelievably lucky position squandered away according naysayers continue believe buy bitcoin theres still plenty time invest retirement option wanted passive income diversification dont think theres anything wrong cheers edit lots commentsquestions taxes yes capital gains yes covered long story short wife worked major tech company paid stock part salary instead cashing shares every month kept lived salary stock tanked years ago lost value finally sold yesterday write losses gains,0.9561,positive,2024-11-23 06:35:13

I went from broke to millionaire in 7 years on a middle-class income thanks to Bitcoin,"I'm posting this anonymously for obvious reasons.

I shared my story here four years ago. If you are curious, you can find it. I've been involved with r/Bitcoin since the summer of 2017 when I first bought Bitcoin in the $2,000 range. I distinctly remember celebrating 250,000 subs here, and this subreddit has been a great educational and meme-motivational resource over that time. 

The Bull Market of 2017 was a wild ride. I experienced my first FOMO as the price went from $2,000 to $20,000. During that up-and-down cycle, I bought around one whole Bitcoin. I bought another full Bitcoin when it dropped to $4,000 in 2018. I felt satisfied with my 2 BTC, but my confidence waned so I didn’t continue stacking over the next 2 years. 

In the spring of 2020, I sold my house, switched jobs, and suddenly found myself sitting on $30,000 in cash from the sale of my home and around 55k in a 401k. I watched as Bitcoin went from 4k to 7, 8, 9, 10, instead of going down to zero as the critics claimed. I decided to go “all-in” with these funds so that’s what I did. I bought around 3 Bitcoin with the cash and the equivalent of just under 5 BTC in GBTC in a new 401k. This brought me to just under 10 Bitcoin split between private custody and a 401k. 

I watched history repeat itself in the fall of 2020, but this time, I had some real exposure to better gains. I watched as my life savings went from around $100,000 to over $600,000 at the top of the cycle in early 2021. Then, I watched as my roughly $600,000 returned to around $170,000 during the bottom of the bear market in 2022. That was tough to witness, but I looked at it and said “I’m still up from where I started.” Once you get past a certain amount of savings, the big swings hit differently. Even during the bear market, I knew I still had at least a 1-year emergency fund, which comforted me.Fast-forward to a short while ago when Bitcoin hit 92k. I soon realized that with the equity in our home and my exposure to BTC, my wife and I were finally millionaires. We’re still driving the same beater cars to work. I rarely sell our BTC, but when I do, I try to buy things/ experiences that will improve the quality of life for my family, and I’m quick to replace what I sold.

I make a middle-class income so I don’t often need to sell for the things I want/ need. Whenever I see a used car, 4-wheeler, boat, or new home I’m tempted to buy, I think to myself “I’d rather have Bitcoin.” The peace of mind it offers far outweighs the benefits of more junk. I used to tell myself I’d pay off my mortgage using proceeds from Bitcoin, but my mortgage is only about 9% of my take-home pay, and the interest rate is lower than inflation. I believe we will see 250k-280k by the end of next year, and the cycle will start again.

One downside to having such a nice safety net is that work has become very tedious. I have very little motivation to put in the extra time or to go “above and beyond.” I do my job, I do it well, I make money for my employer, but I’m not pushing for more like I would if I were still broke. I’ll post again in four more years with an update. I’m hoping to retire by 2030-2034. Stay safe out there, and only invest in Bitcoin what you’re willing to keep!

  
\*edit\* There seems to be a ton of questions regarding whether or not I was actually broke so let me clarify. ""Broke"" to me means you only have a couple thousand dollars to your name. You can be broke and be making money. There are people who make 150k a year and they are broke. In 2017, our household income was probably around 92-95k so just under 48k per person. Earlier in 2017, we bought a home with 100% financing because we couldn't save up a deposit. That home was worth around 135k. We had a 4.5% mortgage rate on a 15-year mortgage. 



We only had $1,000 in an emergency fund when we first started buying Bitcoin. We managed to cut back on some expenses and gradually bought Bitcoin all the way up and down. I don't think we became wholecoiners until the market crashed. I seem to recall the second Bitcoin was purchased aound $4,000, and that money was from a tax return check. That's one of the only ways broke people get a nice chunk of money at once. Trump raised the child tax credit so we got a nice check from that. 

  
We sold our house in 2020 for a little over 200k, so we walked away with like 65k. We then put 25k deposit on a new house, bought some furniture, riding lawnmower, etc and when the dust settled we still had about 30k leftover. That's where the bulk of the Bitcoin came from. Well, that plus the transferring of the 401k. I hope this clears things up.",1733429143.0,went broke millionaire years middleclass income thanks bitcoin im posting anonymously obvious reasons shared story four years ago curious find ive involved rbitcoin since summer first bought bitcoin range distinctly remember celebrating subs subreddit great educational mememotivational resource time bull market wild ride experienced first fomo price went upanddown cycle bought around one whole bitcoin bought another full bitcoin dropped felt satisfied btc confidence waned didnt continue stacking next years spring sold house switched jobs suddenly found sitting cash sale home around k k watched bitcoin went k instead going zero critics claimed decided go allin funds thats bought around bitcoin cash equivalent btc gbtc new k brought bitcoin split private custody k watched history repeat fall time real exposure better gains watched life savings went around top cycle early watched roughly returned around bottom bear market tough witness looked said im still started get past certain amount savings big swings hit differently even bear market knew still least year emergency fund comforted mefastforward short ago bitcoin hit k soon realized equity home exposure btc wife finally millionaires still driving beater cars work rarely sell btc try buy things experiences improve quality life family im quick replace sold make middleclass income dont often need sell things want need whenever see used car wheeler boat new home im tempted buy think id rather bitcoin peace mind offers far outweighs benefits junk used tell id pay mortgage using proceeds bitcoin mortgage takehome pay interest rate lower inflation believe see kk end next year cycle start one downside nice safety net work become tedious little motivation put extra time go beyond job well make money employer im pushing like would still broke ill post four years update im hoping retire stay safe invest bitcoin youre willing keep edit seems ton questions regarding whether actually broke let clarify broke means couple thousand dollars name broke making money people make k year broke household income probably around k k per person earlier bought home financing couldnt save deposit home worth around k mortgage rate year mortgage emergency fund first started buying bitcoin managed cut back expenses gradually bought bitcoin way dont think became wholecoiners market crashed seem recall second bitcoin purchased aound money tax return check thats one ways broke people get nice chunk money trump raised child tax credit got nice check sold house little k walked away like k put k deposit new house bought furniture riding lawnmower etc dust settled still k leftover thats bulk bitcoin came well plus transferring k hope clears things,0.9907,positive,2024-12-05 20:05:43

Italy Raises Bitcoin Tax to 42% – Another Blow to Innovation and Financial Freedom,"The Italian government has just announced that the tax rate on capital gains from Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies will skyrocket from 26% to 42% starting next year. This outrageous increase is part of an attempt to “capture” more from the growing adoption of crypto. The Vice Minister of Economy even stated, “Since the phenomenon is spreading, we are taxing it more.” No clearer message could be sent: instead of encouraging innovation, Italy wants to punish it.

This new tax regime will stifle the budding crypto economy in Italy. Up until now, many Italians saw cryptocurrencies as an opportunity to diversify their investments and potentially counter inflation. But with this new punitive 42% rate, Italy sends a strong signal that any profits made in this space will be met with heavy taxation. This will likely push investors to either stop using crypto or move their assets and activities offshore, depriving the country of potential growth and jobs in blockchain and fintech.

The current 26% tax on crypto gains was already controversial, but this drastic jump makes Italy one of the most hostile jurisdictions for crypto traders and investors. It also raises questions of fairness. Why single out crypto assets with such a heavy tax burden compared to traditional investments? The government’s approach seems to ignore the fact that the crypto market is already highly volatile, making it much harder to guarantee profits compared to conventional financial assets.

What’s worse, these changes will hurt ordinary investors and small-time users more than they will hurt large institutions. Many retail investors, who got involved in crypto during the last bull market, will now face complex reporting obligations and heavy taxes if they decide to sell or trade their holdings. The only ones who might benefit are large players with access to expensive tax advisors who know how to navigate these rules.

This is yet another example of policymakers treating crypto users like cash cows. Instead of fostering innovation, Italy is alienating its crypto community at a time when other European nations, such as Switzerland and Portugal, are embracing blockchain technology and welcoming crypto businesses with favorable regulations.",1729088009.0,italy raises bitcoin tax another blow innovation financial freedom italian government announced tax rate capital gains bitcoin cryptocurrencies skyrocket starting next year outrageous increase part attempt capture growing adoption crypto vice minister economy even stated since phenomenon spreading taxing clearer message could sent instead encouraging innovation italy wants punish new tax regime stifle budding crypto economy italy many italians saw cryptocurrencies opportunity diversify investments potentially counter inflation new punitive rate italy sends strong signal profits made space met heavy taxation likely push investors either stop using crypto move assets activities offshore depriving country potential growth jobs blockchain fintech current tax crypto gains already controversial drastic jump makes italy one hostile jurisdictions crypto traders investors also raises questions fairness single crypto assets heavy tax burden compared traditional investments governments approach seems ignore fact crypto market already highly volatile making much harder guarantee profits compared conventional financial assets whats worse changes hurt ordinary investors smalltime users hurt large institutions many retail investors got involved crypto last bull market face complex reporting obligations heavy taxes decide sell trade holdings ones might benefit large players access expensive tax advisors know navigate rules yet another example policymakers treating crypto users like cash cows instead fostering innovation italy alienating crypto community time european nations switzerland portugal embracing blockchain technology welcoming crypto businesses favorable regulations,0.9565,positive,2024-10-16 14:13:29

$1M Bitcoin Portfolio in my twenties. Crying rn...,"In mid-2022, I bought 11 BTC at \~$20.5K for **$225,000.**

A few days ago, I sold my entire portfolio for **$1,002,000.**

Do I think Bitcoin will hit $100K this year? Yes.

Do I think it will continue its run in 2025? Yes.

I'd much rather secure a guaranteed $1 million at this age than risk losing it by trying to time the market.

I hope everyone reading this KILLS IT during this bull market!

The first investment (other than a house) that they have ever put money into. 

Im so proud.

Edit:
To some common questions

1) when I said they have only invested in a house, I didn't include pension. Yes they have state and private pension and the house is paid off.

2),'tOp SiGnAl' .. I mean adoption is adoption. If you wanna sell your stack because my parents bought some GL with that you wet paper-handed apes. (yes I'm aware this was mostly said tongue in check!)

Most people will never have the ability to buy 1 bitcoin again. ,"With Bitcoin reaching $100k, we're at a critical threshold. While it's still possible for individuals to accumulate 1+ BTC, this window of opportunity is rapidly closing.

Think about the implications as Bitcoin moves toward $200k, $500k, and eventually $1M+ in the coming decade. As institutional adoption increases, with countries and banks competing to secure their Bitcoin reserves, the scarcity will become far more intense than most realize.

The next 20 years, particularly with Pluto in Aquarius (representing technological transformation of financial systems), suggest we're entering an era where Bitcoin becomes increasingly integrated into the global financial infrastructure.

This isn't only about price, it's about accessibility. The opportunity to own a full Bitcoin will likely become increasingly rare for the average person, similar to how owning an entire block of prime real estate in a major city became unreachable for most.

While Bitcoin remains divisible, the psychological and financial significance of owning 1 full BTC will become a marker of early understanding and action during this transformative period.

This needs to be realized by more people because this as a once in a lifetime opportunity. Accumulate and think long term!

None of Schiff's points in the ZH debate with Breedlove even make sense any more, they all either limitations present in gold too or things that are actually handled better by Bitcoin.
